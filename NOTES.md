# Built in Methods and Properties #
For different data types, we have different built-in methods and properties. Use the JS cheatsheet

A built in property does not require you to pass in value with parathensis, while a built in method does:

let name = "david johnson";
name.length // property
name.lastIndexOf("d") // method

Split is a common method used to split a string into an array of strings
