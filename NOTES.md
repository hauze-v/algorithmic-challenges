# Built in Methods and Properties #
For different data types, we have different built-in methods and properties. Use the JS cheatsheet

A built in property does not require you to pass in value with parathensis, while a built in method does:

let name = "david johnson";
name.length // property
name.lastIndexOf("d") // method

Split is a common method used to split a string into an array of strings

## Another way to write for loops ##
let vowels = "aeiou";

for (let elem of vowels) {
  console.log(vowels[elem])
}

remove this later (testing zsh aliass)

## Quick way to check for even is using modular === 0 (%) ##
